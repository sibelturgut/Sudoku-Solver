# Sudoku-Solver
A sudoku solver with sudoku solving techniques

My first Python Project. Rather than classical recursive backtracking algorithms, implements different solving techniques.
Implemented techniques: Hidden Singles, Hidden Pairs, Hidden Triples, Naked Pairs, Pointing Pairs, Pointing Triples.
It can also be used as a guide since it can also be useful for tracking pencil marks with extra few lines of code.
